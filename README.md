## Context

Graduated from the ECAM EPMI Engineering School in Information Systems Management in 2018, I specialized in Data Science through the VIVADATA Full Stack Data Science bootcamp because I like to give meaning to data and see how they impact reality.

I realized several projects in Machine Learning / Deep Learning based on various challenges (Kaggle, University of Oxford...) that you will find here.
