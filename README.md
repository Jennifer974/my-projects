## Context

Graduated from the ECAM EPMI Engineering School in Information Systems Management in 2018, I specialized in Data Science through the VIVADATA Full Stack Data Science bootcamp because I like to give meaning to data and see how they impact reality.

I realized several projects in Machine Learning / Deep Learning based on various challenges (Kaggle, University of Oxford...) that you will find here.

I write this Python script [data_scientist_projects.py](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/blob/master/data_scientist_projects.py) to generate my projects description. 

```
python data_scientist_projects.py
```

### Deep Learning with PyTorch

In 2020, I participated on **Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs** course because to become a good Data Scientist, I have to aware of the technological changement. So, I decided to learn more and do projects with **PyTorch** :
    - [**Insurance Cost Predictions**](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/insurance-cost-predictions)
    *Source* : Kaggle Challenge : [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
    

### Speech Detection

- ðŸŽ™ [Voice Recognition](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/final-project-vivadata-03-2020) : Recognize celebrity speakers from any speech.

### [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/anomaly-detection)

- ðŸ’³ [Credit card fraud detection](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/anomaly-detection/credit-card-fraud-detection) : identify fraudulent credit card transactions

*Source : Kaggle Challenge :* [Credit card fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/)


### [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/NLP)

- ðŸ’¬ [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://github.com/Jennifer974/my-projects/tree/master/NLP/quora-insincere-classification) : detect toxic content to improve online conversations

*Source : Kaggle Challenge :* [Quora insincere questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)


### Customer Churn

- ðŸ›° Telcom Customer Churn : develop focused customer retention programs
