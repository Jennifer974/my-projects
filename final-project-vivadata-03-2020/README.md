Recognize celebrity speakers from any speech :
[Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16wNe2B3FZuiwzTYpEq4Us9K1lSrWAeuP5wIO_sBCzRY/edit?usp=sharing)

I choose this project because I am fascinated by audio synthesis and I decide to study voice recognition part to begin.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- I read documentation on voiceprint to can identify each celebrity voice and audio signal processing :

1.  [*From Natural to Artificial Intelligence - Algorithms and Applications* : Some Commonly Used Speech Feature Extraction Algorithms (book extract)](https://www.intechopen.com/books/from-natural-to-artificial-intelligence-algorithms-and-applications/some-commonly-used-speech-feature-extraction-algorithms)

2. [Deep Learning course : keywords voice recognition](https://deeplylearning.fr/cours-pratiques-deep-learning/reconnaissance-vocale-de-mots-cles/)

3. [Voice Gender Identification project](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech11/#)

4. [Voice Classification with Neural Networks project](https://towardsdatascience.com/voice-classification-with-neural-networks-ff90f94358ec)

### Installing

- I crate a virtual environment for my project to can export it later and avoid versioning issue. I install different packages with `requirements.txt` : 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- I install LibROSA library, a python package for music and audio analysis : [LibROSA - librosa 0.7.2 documentation](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/)

- I install pyAudio library to play and record audio : [PyAudio - documentation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/)

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
