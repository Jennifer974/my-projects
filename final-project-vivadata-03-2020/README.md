## Objectives ðŸš€

Recognize celebrity speakers from any speech :
[Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16wNe2B3FZuiwzTYpEq4Us9K1lSrWAeuP5wIO_sBCzRY/edit?usp=sharing)

I choose this project because I am fascinated by audio synthesis and I decide to study voice recognition part to begin.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
This project is under development, you can see a part of my work in `Final-project.ipynb` jupyter notebook.


### Prerequisites

- I read documentation on voiceprint to can identify each celebrity voice and audio signal processing :

1.  [*From Natural to Artificial Intelligence - Algorithms and Applications* : Some Commonly Used Speech Feature Extraction Algorithms (book extract)](https://www.intechopen.com/books/from-natural-to-artificial-intelligence-algorithms-and-applications/some-commonly-used-speech-feature-extraction-algorithms)

2. [Deep Learning course : keywords voice recognition](https://deeplylearning.fr/cours-pratiques-deep-learning/reconnaissance-vocale-de-mots-cles/)

3. [Voice Gender Identification project](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech11/#)

4. [Voice Classification with Neural Networks project](https://towardsdatascience.com/voice-classification-with-neural-networks-ff90f94358ec)


### Installing

- I crate a virtual environment for my project to can export it later and avoid versioning issue. I install different packages with `requirements.txt` : 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- I install LibROSA library, a python package for music and audio analysis : [LibROSA - librosa 0.7.2 documentation](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/)

- I install pyAudio library to play and record audio : [PyAudio - documentation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/)

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


### Dataset

All important files used for my project saved here [Final Project data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qvcWw5RyMjSaWA3ft_THVjGptLy_09Rt)

ðŸ“¥ I download the VoxCeleb1 dataset on : [VoxCeleb : A large scale audio-visual dataset of human speech](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/index.html#portfolio) :

- I am limited to use the VoxCeleb1 dataset because is lower than which give by the VoxSRC Challenge and my CPU will support it.
- It contains 148 642 audio files (format : wav - duration : 5s in average) extracted from YouTube videos of celebrity interviews : 1251 celebrity speakers :

The repartition in celebrity speakers between men and women is equal.

I constat that American and Englishman are majority so I keep them for my project.

- My data is labelised : Using Supervised Machine Learning Model
- My targets are discrete values : I am in Classification case and I use Deep Learning model
